# semaphore-stellar-docs

Welcome to the Semaphore Stellar documentation repository. This repository serves as the central hub for all technical documentation and research related to the Semaphore Implementation in Stellar.

## About Semaphore and Stellar Integration

### What is Semaphore?
Semaphore is a powerful generic privacy layer that leverages zero-knowledge technology. It enables users to prove their membership in groups and send various types of signals (from votes to endorsements) while maintaining complete privacy. Using zero-knowledge proofs, users can verify their membership and participate in activities across EVM-compatible blockchains without revealing their personal identity.

### Why Stellar?

We're implementing Semaphore in the Stellar ecosystem, since there are currently no Semaphore contracts deployed on this blockchain. The Stellar ecosystem is experiencing significant growth with numerous new projects being developed, making it evident that privacy-preserving solutions (which are already standard in EVM chains) are becoming increasingly necessary. This integration will provide essential privacy infrastructure to support Stellar's expanding ecosystem of applications and users, bringing proven zero-knowledge technology to a blockchain environment where such capabilities are currently unavailable.

## Repository Organization
The contracts can be found in our [contracts repository](https://github.com/ZencypherSolutions/semaphore-stellar-contracts).

The repository is structured to make finding information as straightforward as possible. All technical documentation is available in the root directory, providing immediate access to essential implementation details, guides, and specifications.

For research-related content, we maintain a dedicated `research` folder. This folder contains all research files and related materials. When contributing new research, please ensure your files are added to this folder to maintain our organizational structure.

We have another project to simplify your journey into integrating Semaphore's zero-knowledge privacy layer within the Stellar blockchain that is called **Semaphore Stellar Boilerplate** here you can find [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/ZencypherSolutions/semaphore-stellar-boilerplate) where you can find a starter code, resources to help you start, the design architecture, and for testing test suites that help in the implementation.

And this one [SDK Semaphore Stellar repository](https://github.com/ZencypherSolutions/semaphore-stellar-sdk) is the SDK project for Stellar protocol. 

## Community Support

We have an active community ready to help! For additional support or to engage with our team, you can join our Telegram groups:
